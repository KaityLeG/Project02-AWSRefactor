# Project02-AWSRefactor

<p align="center">

This project focuses on the refactoring or re-architecting of Multi-tier web application.
Refactoring refers to when you reconstruct and improve a codeâ€™s internal structure without actually changing how the code behaves. The code will operate how it usually does, but in a more improved and agile way. You can add new features, scale effectively, have better performance for the application workload. This method aims to boost agility and improve business continuity.
</p>

**EXAMPLE:**
<p>
You have a project that has various services running on physical/virtual/ cloud machines.
And to manage all of it it many require multiple teams to handle it.
The problem with this would be too much operational overhead
Struggling with uptime and scaling.
Upfront Capital expenses and regular operational expenses,
Using local data centers which will be difficult to automate.
  </p>

**SOLUTION:**
* A cloud platform using PAAS and SAAS services from AWS. Flexible and elastic.
* Infrastructure as code
* Pay as you go

This gives ease of infrastructure management that will be easy to use and will not require so many teams.


 **OBJECTIVE:**

* FLEXIBLE INFRASTRUCTURE
* NO UPFRONT COST
* IAAC
* PAAS
* SAAS
</p>

**AWS Cloud services used:**
* Elastic Beanstalk
* AWS Relational Database
* Elasticache
* Route 53
* Amazon MQ
* CloudFront
</p>

  First, create a security group for all the backend services. I chose the default VPC.
  </p>
  <p align="center">

  </p>
  <p align="center">
  The inbound rules for this security group will be SSH as a dummy rule. Then add All traffic and the source will be to intself. So that the traffic can route into itself.
  </p>

  Now, to create the Database subnet group. Again choosing the default VPC.

  <p align="center">
  Now, to create the paramaters for the database subnet group. These parameters will apply to the database when you attach it.
  </p>
  <p align="center">

  <p align="center">
  Here, we will now create the actual AWS RDS database. Create the name. The username login will be "admin" and the password will be auto-generated.
  </p>
  <p align="center">

  </p>
   <p align="center">
  Choose burstible classes with a t2.mirco size. This project will not need much storage.
  </p>
  <p align="center">

   <p align="center">
  For stage I choose General Purpose SSD. This will serve a general web application. I allocated 20 GiB. Again, this will not need alot of storage for this particular project. I enabled autoscaling for the database so it can scale according to the read and writes the application recieves. So you will not need to worry about a crashing application.
  </p>

  <p align="center">
  The connectivty settings, we will not connecft to an ec2 insatnce and keep the network type IPv4. Chose the default VPC once again. Select the DB subnet group we made earlier.
  <p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KaityLeG/Project02-AWSRefactor/main/images/AWSRF10.png" width="700"  title="hover text">
  </p>
  <p align="center">
  For this, we will not be allowing public access to the databse. Only other AWS services will be able to communicate with the DB. Choose an exiting VPC secrity group which is the security group for the backend services created earlier.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KaityLeG/Project02-AWSRefactor/main/images/AWSRF11.png" width="700"  title="hover text">

  <p align="center">
  Click "Password authentication" so there will be a security measure of authenticating using database passwords. For Monitoring, it will be enabled to take a closer look at the performance and metrics of the database.
  </p>
  <p align="center">

  Create the Elasticache subnet group just like we did the RDS database subnet group. Choose the default VPC again.
  </p>
  <p align="center">

 Now to create the Elasticache cluster. It will be on the cloud of course, and we will name it.
  </p>
  <p align="center">

  For the cluster settings I choose the version 1.4.5 for this. The port will be on 11211 the memcached port. Select the parameter group we created for memcached. Choose t2.micro for the Node. And there will be one node.
  </p>
  <p align="center">

  </p>
  <p align="center">
  Now go to EC2 instances and create an EC2 instance to log in and intialize the RDS Database created earlier. I named it "my-sql-client". You can choose any OS but for this I chose Ubuntu. For any one you choose just make sure you understand how it works.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KaityLeG/Project02-AWSRefactor/main/images/AWSRF29.png" width="700"  title="hover text">
  </p>
  <p align="center">
  Log into the EC2 instance created to intialize the database and run these commands to update packages first. Keep in mind this is for Ubuntu. Update according to the OS you used for this EC2 instance. Here I also installed mysql to the instance. For linux it will be different. it will be maria-db instead of mysql-client. 
  </p>
  <p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KaityLeG/Project02-AWSRefactor/main/images/AWSRF30.png" width="700"  title="hover text">

  Now, go back to the backend security group and add MySQL/Aurora port to the EC2 instance that was just created.
  </p>
  <p align="center">

  Use the command above to log into the mysql database created. Use the user "admin" and the generated password RDS gave when we selected it and the RDS was created.
  </p>
  <p align="center">

  Get the endpoint URL of the RDS database. Run this command with the proper username and password of your database you created. This command will basically input the "accounts" database to this file.
  </p>
  <p align="center">

  For Application Deployments, choose Rolling. Rolling deployment will keep downtine to a minimum by rotating out instances as they are updated so a version of the application will always be up and running until all the latest changes to the application instances are applied. It will delete old instances and add new ones, completing the update cycle and the user will experience very minimum downtime if none at all. a 50% percentage will keep half of the instances up and leave the other half to be updated at a time.

  Here, I created a CloudFront distribution. This will allow users to access the application in the fastest way possible. The reason that it will be helpful is that a CDN like CloudFront will send the info that is cached data from the nearest edge location. That way, users will not have to make its way back to the application completely. It will route to cloudfront first to recieve information thats has been accessed once before.

  For Origin, choose the DNS record we created and just accessed.
  For Protocol, chose Match Viewer. So that which ever one the user accesses it will be able to serve. Whether its HTTP or HTTPS.
  Chose the SSL protocol.

  Dont need to edit Origin path because it will already route to /login. I created the name as the DNS name. Didnt enable Origin shield for this project. For the Default cache behavior, these are the settings.

  For the Cache policy I chose CacheOptimized. This now created CloudFront will allow traffic to recieve the application in a much faster and improved way.

    This project is now completed and you can now see with the combination of PAAS and SAAS services from AWS this project remained the same but internally it behaves with better performance and easier to manage.
